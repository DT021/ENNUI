image for creating layers and activations that support dragging out. 
flip in/out iconography
drag out from black dot
add breakpoint/checkpoint to examine values
track a specific example through the network
view graph of layers during training on mouseover/click
boarder radius (rounded corners) around train.
highlight stray gates on train.
bug on activation connection to layer
start+end nodes set initial positions, but leave draggable
tanh activation instead of softmax
show immutable params on output node on click
graphs: train/val percent vs acc, loss vs. epochs 
make sharable text to reproduce someone else's model/share your own

Future:
padding/different dimensionality for conv
supernodes, multiselect (ctrl + click) + copy (ctrl c)
more activations/layers e.g. leaky relu and recurrent layers e.g. lstm cells
premade architectures
model histories
select optimizers, regularization, learning rate/step size
